# Yumi
Some commonly used functionality.

Yumi stands for [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize) in [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin). The name comes from the fact that corn is the most cultivated grain on the planet.

## Contents

The package currently does the following:

- It re-exports some ”official” packages:
    - `Algorithms` from [`swift-algorithms`](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) by Apple.
    - `Collections` from [`swift-collections`](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections) by Apple.
- And some more biased choices:
    - `IdentifiedCollections` from [`swift-identified-collections`](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-identified-collections) by [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co).
- `countEach(where:)` as a replacement for [SE-0220](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0220-count-where.md).
