# ``Yumi``

Some commonly used functionality.

## Overview

Yumi provides some handy algorithms, data structures, and other utilities that work on all platforms Swift support. Some of them are provided by re-exporting existing packages, such as `Algorithms` from [`swift-algorithms`](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-identified-collections). Others are implemented here.

Yumi stands for [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize) in [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin). The name is picked because corn is the most cultivated grain on the planet.
